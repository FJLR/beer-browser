# Beer browser

Using the free API at https://punkapi.com/, we can make a web application that browses through various beers.  (If you're not into beers, take a look at this [link](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/) for other APIs).  

We can start by listing some beers, and then allowing the user to select one and show some details (eg its image and description.)
